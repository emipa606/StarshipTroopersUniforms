[h1] DRESS LIKE A TRUE CITIZEN TODAY! [/h1]

The personnel of the United Citizen's Federation needs clothing, and we seek to supply such demand. From fleet to Mobile Infantry, Marines to Naval Intelligence; we have it all! Not one man or woman will be found with ought their proper uniform; after all, you can't [strike] die [/strike] kill bugs in regular civilian clothing!

[h1] TROUBLE IN THE QUARANTINE ZONE: [/h1]

Federation military officials have stated recently that the arachnid quarantine zone has grown to begin encompassing the far-out Rimworlds. The council has unanimously agreed to begin an offensive for this critical territory of space.

As Sky Marshal Adams put it:

[b] [i] "To let a system, light years beyond ours, fall to the Arachnid menace; is to let all systems to become infested by these bugs. We will NOT GIVE AN INCH OF GROUND!" [/i] [/b]

Military outposts are far and few between in the outer edges of the galaxy, making travel difficult and dangerous to these Rimworlds. To further the threat, the arachnids have begun a shelling campaign via asteroids, many ships have been lost, however; the Federation's Military might and progress is unstoppable.
